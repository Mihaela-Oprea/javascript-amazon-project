# 🛒 Amazon Clone Project

This is my **completed project from the "JavaScript Full Course" by SuperSimpleDev**, where I built an Amazon clone as part of the course curriculum. I successfully finished the course, completed this project, and obtained the certification.

The project simulates key features of an e-commerce platform, including product listings, a shopping cart, checkout process, and order tracking. It was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.
